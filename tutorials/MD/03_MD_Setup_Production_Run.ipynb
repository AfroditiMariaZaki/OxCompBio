The .pdb file of the protein can be obtained from the protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/), but it is probably easier for now to just copy it from the shared directory to your working directory. In fact, most of the files you need can be found in this directory so if you get confused/stuck/lost etc then you can always look here to check you did things correctly.\n",

    "or\\\n",
    "`% nedit 1hsg.pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to prepare our protein for simulation. First of all we will extract only the protein coordinates from the pdb file into a new file called `protein.pdb`. To do this enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`% grep ATOM 1hsg.pdb > protein.pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your preferred text editor to open the protein.pdb file and see how it differs from the 1hsg.pdb file.\n",

    "\n",
    "`% gmx pdb2gmx -f protein.pdb -ignh -o protein.gro`\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should run and present a list of force-fields from which to select. Select the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field which should be option 6 in the list followed by 1 to select the recommended TIP3P water. If all goes well this should generate several files:\n",

Ideally you would minimize down until the forces were below a certain level (tolerance), but we will just give a quick burst of 200 steps here.

Therefore instead of typing the `mdrun` command -that will initiate the energy minimisation- directly on the command line, we will submit a script that will submit the job to the job scheduler. Copy this script to your working directory:\n",

    "<img src=\"em_potential_energy.png\" width=500 height=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Run\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we would normally run a short simulation where the protein atoms are restrained while the water molecules\n",
    "and ions are allowed to freely move around and equilibrate around the protein. For this tutorial, we will skip this bit due to\n",
    "limited time. Now finally let us perform some molecular dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx grompp -c em.gro -p ../setup/topol.top -f /home/shared/data/md.mdp -maxwarn 1 -o md.tpr`\n",

    "\n",
    "`% sbatch submit_md.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the status of the job again as described previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment it is set up to run for 1000 ps. This will take several minutes to complete depending on the waiting time in the queue - time for lunch! You don't have to wait for it to finish completely though, although now might be a good time for a break to allow at least some data to appear. The analysis can be done on the output files that will be generated or you can always use the \"one I made earlier\" in the directory /home/shared/prerun/run (This is 1000 ps simulation of the same system).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the end of the production run, it would be useful to obtain some properties that will give us an insight into our protein system.\\\n",
    "There are various so-called ensembles that are used for protein simulations - probably the most common is a system where the number of particles, the pressure and the temperature are held constant (NPT). This is usually achieved by means of a heat-bath. Nevertheless, it is usually a good idea to check these as a function of time through the trajectory just to make sure nothing unexpected happened. First let us check the temperature of our simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx energy -f md.edr -s md.tpr -o 1hsg_temperature.xvg`\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will then present you with a large table of all the values recorded in the energy (.edr) file. We want to examine temperature so type 13, press enter and then 0 and press enter again. The program will then analyse the temperature and present some statistics of the analysis at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of properties that is quite useful to examine is the various energetic contributions to the energy. The total energy should be constant. but the various contributions can change and this can sometimes indicate something interesting or strange happening in your simulation. Let us look at some energetic properties of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx energy -s md.tpr -f md.edr -o 1hsg_energies.xvg`\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall select short-range lennard-jones (7), short range coulombic (9) and the potential energy (11). End your selection with a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to renumber the em.gro file so that the residues of the two chains will not have the same residue number. This will be necessary for when we calculate the RSF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx editconf -f em.gro -o em_renumbered.gro -resnr 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will plot and explore the temperature and the energetic components that we obtained in the next section of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Transfer \n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the simulation is finished, you should go to your local terminal and transfer the files from the remote directory to your local directory.\\\n",
    "First, in your local terminal, go to the `OxCompBio/tutorials/MD directory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use `scp` to transfer the remote run subdirectory to your local directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`% scp username@oscgate.arc.ox.ac.uk:/home/username/run/ .`\n",
