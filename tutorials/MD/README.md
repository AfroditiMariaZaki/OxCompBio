# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

## Contents

The Oxford Computational Biochemistry Molecular Dynamics tutorial utilises the  GROMACS simulation package and describes the steps for setting up, equilibrating and simulating a protein-ligand system in water. 

The tutorial also makes use of the VMD software for visualisation purposes, Gromacs tools for performing basic analysis and the xmgrace package for plotting.

## Requirements
The following packages were used: 

Gromacs version 2019.
VMD version 1.9.2.
Grace version 5.1.25

If you are attending the Oxford Computational Biochemistry workshop and are using the Linux VM, these have already been installed for you.
