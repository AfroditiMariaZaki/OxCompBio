    "* [NGLView](http://nglviewer.org/#nglview): An IPython/Jupyter widget to interactively view molecular structures and trajectories.\n",

    "\n",
    "You could either take your time to familiarize with both, or select which one you prefer to delve into.\n",
    "NGLView is great for looking at things directly within a jupyter notebook, but VMD can be a more powerful tool for visualizing, generating high quality images and videos, but also analysing simulation trajectories. \n",
