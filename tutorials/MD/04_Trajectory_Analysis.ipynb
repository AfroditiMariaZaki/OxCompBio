It should load up the starting coordinates into the main window. Then click browse in Molecule File Browser window. Select run and then md.xtc. Select \"OK\" and then hit \"load\". The trajectory should start loading into the main VMD window. Although things will be moving, you can see that its quite difficult to visualize the individual components. That is one of the problems with simulating such large a complicated\n",
    "systems. VMD makes it quite easy to look at individual components of a system. For example, let us consider the protein only. On the main menu, left click on Graphics and select \"Representations\". A new menu will appear (Graphical Representations). In the box entitled \"Selected Atoms\" type protein and hit enter. Only those atoms that form part of the protein are now selected. Various other selections and drawing methods will help to visualize different aspects of the simulation. More help on the selections is available here.\n",
