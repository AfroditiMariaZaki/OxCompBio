# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Docking Tutorial

## Contents

This tutorial teaches the basics of molecular docking.

Here we dock small molecules indinavir and nelfinavir into HIV-1 protease.

## Requirements

Although based on a course than ran for several years that ran in a computer lab, this version has been rewritten to be platform agnostic such that anyone with a laptop (linux, mac or windows) can run it at their leisure.

The following software installations are required to do this workshop:

For the molecular docking calculations:
- [Autodock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/)

For analysis and visualisation:
- [Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/)

One route for system preparation:
- [AutodockTools](http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/adt)

An alternative route for system preparation:
- [ADFR](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/)
- openbabel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) - via conda

For electrostatics visualization
- [APBS] (http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/)

## Getting started

Please see https://bigginlab.github.io/OxCompBio/docking.html for the tutorial instructions.

All calculations should be done under the `1HSG`, `1HSG_nefinavir` and `1HSG_APBS` folders found under `dock-prac`.

Backup data files can be found under `dock-prac/backup`.
