Currently this repository holds the files for the python section of the course (to be held on Tuesday the 11th of December 2018).

#### Contents:

The Python_tutorial_python3.ipynb jupyter notebook contains the course instructions and is accompanied by the Python_tutorial_solutions_python3.ipynb notebook which contains the solutions.

#### Python requirements:
Python 3.6+, MDAnalysis (conda-forge channel), Numpy, Matplotlib, nglview (bioconda channel).

#### Known bugs: 
The nglview part of the notebook is known to be faulty in non-Linux environments (Windows & MacOS).

#### Getting started:

Executing the setup.sh bash script will automatically set up a local anaconda python 3.6 environment named `WTcourse` adding relevant exports to your .bashrc file.
